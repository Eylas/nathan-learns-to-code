Welcome to nathan-learns-to-code
This is where allegedly nathan learns to code

We're not super sure if that will happen yet, but we remain optimistic

## Overview

### Language

In this repository we'll be writing some coding exercises, they're gonna be real simple, and they're gonna be focused on **javascript**, you're also allowed to do them in other languages, but we don't suggest silly things like that, since you might just fall down the "what language to choose rabbit hole".

### Submitting Assignments

For every assignment, you'll be working in a new branch, then all the work you'll do in either a folder or file in the /answers repository. Generally the assignments can fit in a single file, and if they don't, we'll make sure to mention it! These files don't need to contain code that works, or can run on its own, we just use it as a dump for stuff to review together.
When you feel done with an assignment, just create a pull request and we'll review it together.

### Work Guidance

If you'd like help with an assignment, feel free to reach out to us any time, we can help in a variety of ways, ranging from a hint in the right direction or a link to some documentation, all the way to pair programming.

You can write your code in an editor and copy-paste it in to the console of your browser, you can write your code directly in to the attached template.html, or you can copypaste it in to the eval box in the template and read the results from the console. In either case, you will not be building any front-end, and output will be handled through the console.

*Ready? Well let's get to it!*

## You'll find numbered assignments in the folders in this repository, each one contains a readme.md with instructions that you can read directly on the github website!
